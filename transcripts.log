Chunk 0: Hello. Can you hear anything?
Chunk 1: The business again lost money and fell into a crisis. Nishida had expected to be made Toshiba's CEO and president, but how can Toshiba anoint
Chunk 2: someone from a money losing division. Determined, Nishida introduced new laptops and hired Japanese contract manufacturer companies and Chinese labor
Chunk 3: By 2004, over 80% of production was outsourced, but the PC division returned to profitability that year ahead of
Chunk 4: By 2005, Toshiba was the world's third-largest notebook PC vendor after Dell and HP. The turnaround seemed complete.
Chunk 5: and the company promoted Nishida to the top spot. The chain-smoking executive was known for being unusually aggressive and willing to make bold moves.
Chunk 6: One of those old moves was the fateful 2006 acquisition of America's leading nuclear energy company. Nuclear Energy.
Chunk 7: And now for something completely different. Let's talk nuclear reactors. Westinghouse Electric Company is a very good idea.
Chunk 8: The Elder Westinghouse Company began as the nuclear power division of the Westinghouse Company. The Elder Westinghouse Company is quite famous, founded by the legendary inventor George
Chunk 9: Westinghouse, a pioneer of alternating current motors and transformers, the electrical kind. Their nuclear energy division emerged after World War II.
Chunk 10: thanks to a military partnership with the U.S. government. In 1949, Admiral Hyman George Rickover became head of the nuclear power branch
Chunk 11: of the Navy's burrow of ships. He was a brilliant, pugnacious, and abrasive electrical engineer born in Poland. That same year, 1949,
Chunk 12: the Soviet Union detonated their first nuclear weapon, kicking off the Cold War. This Soviet breakthrough provided the military impetus for a submarine with
Chunk 13: unlimited endurance and high submerged speed. Rickover moved heaven, earth, and government bureaucracy to make it happen. Rickover and
Chunk 14: his team began developing two known reactor designs and assigned one each to a different military contractor. The third ways to classify a nuclear reactor
Chunk 15: or by the fuel they use within their core, the moderator material they use to slow down neutrons inside said core, and the coolant they use to cool the reactor.
Chunk 16: General Electric was contracted to develop a liquid sodium reactor, meaning it used molten sodium as a coolant
Chunk 17: and Graflike as the moderator. Westinghouse, on the other hand, was contracted to develop a water-cooled reactor design first created at the Oak Ridge National
Chunk 18: It had two water circuits, a primary and secondary. Water in the primary circuit is pumped at high pressure through the uranium powered reactor.
Chunk 19: The water in this circuit heats up, but does not boil or evaporate due to stiff pressure. The heat is then transferred from the primary to secondary circuit.
Chunk 20: that heat thusly creates steam for running the turbine, which is why we call these nuclear steam supply systems. These systems
Chunk 21: are paired with a turbine generator that turns the steam into power. The largest American vendors of such turbines are Westinghouse and General Electric.
Chunk 22: This particular nuclear steam supply system design later received the name Pressurized Water Reactor, or PWR, and is further
Chunk 23: prototype went critical in 1953. Steaming ahead at full speed, Brookover had pushed Westinghouse to build a modified variant at a slightly
